### Make Change Project

#### Description

This is a program to calculate change for a purchase, based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. The user is prompted asking for the price of the item and the amount of money was tendered by the customer. If the amount tendered is more than the cost of the item, displays the number of bills and coins that should be given to the customer unless an appropriate message is displayed.

#### Lessons Learned

1. Using appropriate data type for user input to enable working on the amount of money based on dollar bills and coins.
2. Proper use of int and double and converting them to each other as needed.
(for example: defining variable "divisor1" as a double and converting it to int as "int twentyDollarBill = (int) divisor1".)
3. use of Math.round method to round up a long result of dividing double numbers.
(for example: returning 3.27 from (Math.round (65.35/20 *100)) / 100.0)
